This is my WGU Master's Program Capstone! Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify 
images of malaria-infected blood work.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Research Question</p>

Can convolutional neural networks (CNNs) be used to identify malaria-infected red blood cells
in patient blood samples?

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Context</p>

&emsp;Malaria kills hundreds of thousands of people every year and is challenging to diagnose
in resource-limited settings. The standard method is microscopic examination of a Giemsa-
stained blood sample by a trained microbiologist. While effective, it is impractical where
resources, particularly trained personnel, are scarce. This results in delayed or missed diagnoses,
increasing mortality. Developing a faster, accurate diagnostic method that reduces reliance on
trained professionals could improve treatment access and save lives. This capstone project
proposes the use of CNNs to accurately process blood work images to diagnose people with
malaria as an alternative diagnostic tool.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Hypotheses</p>

&emsp;The null hypothesis states that the convolutional neural network cannot predict cells
infected with malaria with statistical significance, achieving at least 90% accuracy. Conversely,
the alternative hypothesis states that the convolutional neural network can predict cells infected
with malaria with statistical significance, achieving at least 90% accuracy.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Data Analysis</p>

&emsp;The images for this project were downloaded from Kaggle and organized into folders for
healthy and malaria-infected cells. They were split into training, validation, and testing sets with
17,879, 4,469, and 5,512 images, respectively. The images were scaled to 192x192 pixels using
TensorFlowâ€™s ImageDataGenerator() function. This approach maintained image details
and prepared the data for use in TensorFlow, resulting in a properly divided and scaled dataset
for training, validating, and testing the convolutional neural network (CNN).

&emsp;The initial model was a simple neural network with only input and output layers,
achieving a validation accuracy of 0.512. Adding a convolutional layer with 16 filters and ReLU
activation improved validation accuracy to 0.724 but led to overfitting. Introducing a dropout
layer reduced overfitting and increased validation accuracy. Adding a hidden dense layer
significantly increased model size, which was managed by incorporating a max pooling layer,
achieving 0.897 validation accuracy. Further refining with an additional convolutional layer and
a final dense layer, the CNN achieved a final validation accuracy of 0.934 and training accuracy
of 0.964.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Findings</p>

&emsp;After using the final model to make predictions on the testing images, the p-value
obtained from the chi-square test on the confusion matrix of the predictions is approximately
zero and the overall accuracy of the model on the testing images is 94.4%. Therefore, the null
hypothesis is rejected. This result indicates that the CNN can accurately classify blood cell
images as either healthy or malaria-infected.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Limitations</p>

&emsp;A limitation of this project is the requirement for the technology to host the CNN at
testing sites, which may not always be feasible due to the lack of necessary infrastructure, such
as reliable electricity, in remote and under-resourced areas. Addressing this limitation will
require careful consideration of each potential testing location and its unique challenges. Possible
solutions could include creating portable, self-sufficient diagnostic devices that can operate
independently of existing infrastructure.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Proposed Actions</p>

&emsp;The recommended course of action is to partner with humanitarian and medical aid
programs to assess how and where this CNN can address needs and relieve strain on the medical
system in the areas they serve. These collaborations can identify the most beneficial deployment
areas and integrate the CNN into existing healthcare frameworks, ensuring effective and
sustainable implementation to improve malaria diagnosis in resource-limited settings.

<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 5px;">Expected Benefits</p>

&emsp;The implications of this finding are significant for malaria-prevalent regions with limited
resources and microbiologists. Automating the diagnostic process with this CNN model offers a
reliable alternative to traditional microscopic examination that relies on trained personnel,
accelerating diagnostics, improving access and speed to treatment, and potentially reducing
malaria-related deaths. This success also highlights machine learning's potential in other global
health initiatives.
