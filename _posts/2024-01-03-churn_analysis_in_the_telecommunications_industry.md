&emsp;The data used for this project come from one of WGU's <a href="https://cbhorton6819.github.io/project_files/churn_analysis/churn_clean.csv" download>csv datasets</a> sourced from an unnamed telecommunications company. There are 50 variables contained in the dataset, which will be processed in the analysis, but a description of each variable can be found in this <a href="https://cbhorton6819.github.io/project_files/churn_analysis/dictionary.pdf" target="_blank">data dictionary</a>. My Python notebook can be viewed <a href="https://nbviewer.org/urls/cbhorton6819.github.io/project_files/churn_analysis/churn_analysis.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>.
