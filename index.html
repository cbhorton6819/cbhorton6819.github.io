&emsp;Hello, My name is Colton Horton, and thank you for visiting my portfolio! 
I am originally from West Lafayette, Indiana (Go Boilermakers!) and 
I just finished my master's program studying data analytics at Western Governors University. 
I am currently a data analyst intern at FirstEnergy Corp., and I'm looking to progress my career in data science.

    target="_blank">here</a> or by clicking the link in the sidebar to the left. 
    You can also view the web version of my resume by visiting the "Resume" tab above.</p>

&emsp;I decided to pursue this career because I enjoy discovering creative ways to solve complex problems using data.
I approach analytics with a wholistic view, trying to find the right tool for the job, whatever that might be.
I have experience with: 
<ul style="margin-bottom: 1.33em">
    <li>Statistical Modeling</li>
    <li>Time Series Analysis</li>
    <li>Machine Learning Models</li>
    <li>Data Mining</li>
    <li>Bayesian Inference</li>
    <li>Deep Learning</li>
</ul>

&emsp;My job is to work with you and your data to discover trends and identify strategic solutions for your business. 
My aim is to present this information in a functional, user-friendly, and eye-catching way that is inclusive for all audiences to 
understand and engage with. Below is a selection of data science projects from my portfolio that I particularly loved working on.
